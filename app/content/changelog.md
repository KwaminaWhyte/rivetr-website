## [Unreleased]

## [0.10.23] - 2026-05-27

### Added
- **Host-protection resource defaults — a runaway container can no longer hang the host** — Previously per-container memory/CPU limits were applied only when a user set them explicitly; an app/service/database with no limit ran unbounded and could exhaust host RAM (the same failure mode that takes down unprotected Coolify hosts). Every running container now inherits configurable safety defaults when it sets no limit of its own (per-resource limits still override):
  - `runtime.default_memory_limit` (default `512m`) — Docker/Podman OOM-kills the container at this cap; swap is disabled at the cap (`memory_swap = memory`) so a container cannot escape it via swap.
  - `runtime.default_pids_limit` (default `512`) — fork-bomb protection.
  - `runtime.default_oom_score_adj` (default `500`) — biases the kernel OOM killer toward the offending container and away from host daemons (Rivetr, dockerd), so the platform survives and can restart the casualty.
  - Applied at the single `runtime.run()` chokepoint, so apps, services, managed databases, preview deployments, and rollbacks all inherit it. Implemented for both the Docker (`HostConfig`) and Podman (CLI flags) runtimes. Set `default_memory_limit = ""` to opt out.
- **Container log rotation + critical-disk auto-reclaim — a full disk can no longer hang the host** — Container logs were unbounded (Docker's default `json-file` driver grows forever) and `disk_monitor` only logged warnings, taking no action. Now every container gets log rotation defaults (`runtime.default_log_max_size` = `10m`, `runtime.default_log_max_file` = `3`; Docker `HostConfig.log_config`, Podman `--log-opt max-size`), and when disk usage crosses the critical threshold the monitor automatically reclaims space by pruning images + build cache. Closes the second host-hang vector (disk) after RAM.
- **Database integrity check on startup** — Startup self-check now runs a SQLite `PRAGMA quick_check`; corruption (e.g. from a prior power loss or full disk) is surfaced loudly in the startup report. Non-critical — the server still starts — but the problem is no longer silent. New `db::integrity_check()` helper.
- **Tooling & reference docs** — Added `rustfmt.toml` (stable-only formatting config), a `[lints]` table in `Cargo.toml` (codified clippy/rustc lint levels), `docs/reference/configuration.md` (every `rivetr.toml` field with type/default/description), and `docs/reference/api.md` (full REST endpoint catalog).

### Tests
- Expanded unit coverage for core pure-logic modules: build-type auto-detection (`src/engine/build_detect.rs`) and API input validation (`src/api/validation/apps.rs`) — +33 tests covering build-type precedence, SSR-vs-static framework detection, and security-relevant input validation (shell-metacharacter/command-injection blocking, path traversal, oversized/empty input). Suite now 246 passing.

## [0.10.22] - 2026-05-27

### Fixed
- **Panic isolation — one failure can no longer crash the whole server** — The release profile used `panic = "abort"`, which turned a panic in *any* of the ~79 spawned Tokio tasks into a full-process kill (dropping the proxy and every routed app). Switched to `panic = "unwind"` so a panic unwinds only the task that hit it. Combined with `parking_lot` (no mutex poisoning) and the existing per-connection proxy tasks, panics are now isolated: a bad request, a failing deploy, or a panicking background tick fails alone while the proxy and other apps keep serving.
  - New `utils::supervise::guarded()` helper wraps periodic loop bodies in `catch_unwind` so a panicking tick logs and the loop continues instead of the background task silently dying. Applied to all 16 background loops (stats collection/history/retention, scheduler ×4, resource-metrics collector, container monitor, uptime checker, log cleaner, deployment cleanup, cost calculator, disk monitor, database backups, update checker, rate-limit cleanup) and the deployment-engine queue consumer.
  - Hardened the 8 reverse-proxy hot-path `Response::builder().unwrap()` calls. Header values built from untrusted input (Host, request path, redirect target, HTTP Basic auth realm) could contain control characters that make the builder error and panic; they now fall back to a header-less `empty_response(status)` (built via `Response::new`, which cannot fail).

### Changed
- Release builds now unwind on panic (slightly larger binary, negligible runtime cost) in exchange for process-level resilience.

## [0.10.21] - 2026-05-02

### Added
- **Database-to-app linking with auto env injection (B25)** — A new "Linked Databases" section on the App Env Vars tab lets users connect a managed database (Postgres / MySQL / MariaDB / Redis / Mongo) to an app with one click. The next deployment automatically receives `DATABASE_URL`, `HOST`, `PORT`, `USER`, `PASSWORD`, and `DB` env vars (or `REDIS_URL` / `MONGODB_URL` for those types) using the database's internal connection string. An optional prefix (`ANALYTICS_`, `CACHE_`, …) lets the same app link multiple DBs without key collisions. User-defined `env_vars` always win over injected vars (the preview UI strikes through overridden keys).
  - New migration `106_database_app_links.sql` and module `src/api/database_links.rs`.
  - New endpoints: `GET/POST /api/apps/:app_id/links`, `DELETE /api/apps/:app_id/links/:link_id`, `GET /api/apps/:app_id/linked-env-vars`.
  - Pipeline change in `src/engine/pipeline/start.rs` to merge linked-DB vars into the deployment env.
- **Inline credentials display on the project DB list (U6)** — Each database card on the project detail page now has a "Show credentials" toggle that expands the connection string, username, and password inline (with copy-to-clipboard buttons and a password reveal toggle), so users no longer have to drill into each DB to get its connection info.

### Fixed
- **MySQL 8 connection broken via published connection string (B6)** — Managed MySQL containers now start with `--skip-ssl` (matching MariaDB) so clients can connect via `mysql://user:pass@host:3306/db` without TLS errors. Reverted the v0.10.20 `?ssl-mode=DISABLED` query-string workaround that had been incorrectly applied to MariaDB too.
- **Audit `ip_address` was always `null` (B8)** — `ClientIp` extractor is now wired into all 30+ handlers that emit audit logs (`src/api/{api_tokens,github_apps,ssh_keys,sso,two_factor,env_vars,bulk,databases,auth,oauth,projects,git_providers,apps,services,deployments}.rs`). Direct (non-proxied) clients get their socket IP recorded; proxied requests use `X-Forwarded-For` / `X-Real-IP`.
- **Disk-stats path inconsistency (B20)** — Dashboard "Disk Usage" card and Monitoring page were measuring different mountpoints (`/` vs `/var/lib/rivetr`). Backend now canonicalizes `data_dir` via `fs::canonicalize` so both surfaces show the same number for the same data path.

### UX
- **Sidebar user menu (U1)** — Added explicit `gap-3` between avatar and text, hover/focus states, and a chevron that rotates 180° when the menu is open. The user pill is now obviously interactive.
- **Deploy menu commit/tag and ZIP-file modals (U3)** — Both menu items now actually open their dialogs. Bug was a Radix dropdown→dialog focus race; fixed by using `onSelect` with `preventDefault()` + a deferred state update.
- **Template page category anchors (U5)** — Each category section has an `id` anchor and "View all N" links smooth-scroll to the heading + expand the section inline. Tab switching also scrolls to the top of the filtered grid.
- **Resource Limits live-apply (U9)** — Resource Limits card now calls `POST /api/apps/:id/apply-limits` after Save when the container is running (uses `docker update` under the hood). Helper text and toast switch between "applied immediately" (running) and "next deployment" (stopped).

### Removed
- The v0.10.20 `?ssl-mode=DISABLED` MySQL connection-string workaround (replaced by the `--skip-ssl` server-side fix in B6).

[0.10.21]: https://github.com/KwaminaWhyte/rivetr/compare/v0.10.20...v0.10.21

## [0.10.20] - 2026-05-02

### Added
- **Coolify-style deploy log side panel** — A dockable side panel now opens automatically whenever a Deploy, Start, or Restart is triggered (apps, services, managed databases) and streams the underlying image-pull and container-start activity in real time. Powered by a new in-process `StartLogRegistry` broadcaster (`src/api/start_logs.rs`) plus per-resource WS/REST routes:
  - `GET /api/services/:id/start-stream` (WebSocket) and `GET /api/services/:id/start-events` (snapshot)
  - `GET /api/databases/:id/start-stream` (WebSocket) and `GET /api/databases/:id/start-events` (snapshot)
  - Frontend: `DeployPanelProvider` + `DeploySidePanel` mounted at the dashboard root.
- **MariaDB as a managed database type** — MariaDB joins the managed database catalogue with versions **11 (default)**, **10.11**, **10.6**, and **10.5**. The frontend now correctly routes MariaDB through the `mariadb://...` MySQL-compatible scheme, mounts data at `/var/lib/mysql`, and uses `mariadb-dump` for backups. Backend tests (`test_mariadb_config`, `test_generate_env_vars_mariadb`) cover the config/env-var paths.
- **`scripts/deploy-vm.sh`** — Local Parallels Ubuntu ARM64 VM deploy mirror of `deploy-dev.sh` for faster iteration on Apple Silicon (cross-compiles `aarch64-unknown-linux-gnu` via zigbuild, uploads to the Parallels VM, restarts systemd unit).

### Fixed
- **Container monitor service health check broken since v0.10.18 (HIGH, B4)** — `container_monitor::health::check_services` was issuing a SELECT that omitted the columns added by migration `105_service_public_access` (`public_access`, `external_port`, `expose_container_port`). `query_as` failed to deserialize on every 30-second poll, silently disabling crash detection for all Compose services. The query now SELECTs the full column set so service health monitoring works again.
- **`/api/apps/:id/insights` returned 503 when AI provider not configured (B3)** — The endpoint now returns `404 NOT_FOUND` when no AI provider is configured, matching the semantics of "feature not available." This eliminates the misleading per-page-load 503 in the browser console and the `tower_http: response failed classification=Status code: 503` warn spam in `journalctl -u rivetr`.
- **Docker network "endpoint already exists" warnings on every restart (B28)** — The container reconcile-on-startup path called `connect_network` for every running container, and Docker returned a 403 if the container was already attached. The connect helper now matches the specific `403 + "already exists"` pair as an idempotent no-op; other connect errors still log a warning.
- **MariaDB/MySQL post-start user-provisioning warning is now silenced when the entrypoint already created the user (B5)** — The user is provisioned by the official entrypoint via `MARIADB_USER` / `MYSQL_USER`; the redundant follow-up logged a misleading warning even on success.
- **Audit log now records the full set of mutating actions (B7)** — `token.create`, `token.delete`, `app.start/stop/restart`, `app.delete`, `app.update`, `service.create/start/stop`, `database.delete`, `deployment.cancel`, `deployment.rollback`, `env_var.create/update/delete`, `domain.add/remove` were missing from prior versions.
- **`/api/audit?limit=N` alias accepted (B9)** — REST clients that send `?limit=` (Coolify/Dokploy convention) now get the same behavior as `?per_page=`.
- **POST/DELETE endpoints accept empty body / no `Content-Type` (B10)** — `DELETE /api/apps/:id`, `POST /api/deployments/:id/rollback`, and `POST /api/apps/:id/deployments/:did/cancel` no longer return 415 when called without a body.
- **Cancel deployment in non-cancellable state returns 409 (B11)** — Was 404, which masked the fact that the deployment exists but isn't cancellable. Now returns `409 Conflict` with `code: "conflict"` and a descriptive message.
- **Rollback `commit_message` references the correct deployment id (B12)** — Was using the previously-running deployment id instead of the path-param target.
- **Old running deployment marked `replaced` (not `failed`) after rollback (B13)** — `failed` connoted a build error that didn't happen; `replaced` is the accurate transition.
- **Stable internal hostname surfaced in App model (B14/B15)** — `GET /api/apps/:id` now exposes a derived `internal_hostname` field (either `custom_container_name` or `rivetr-<app-name>`) so the Network tab "service-to-service connection example" stays correct across restarts even when the container itself has a `-restart-<hash>` suffix.
- **Templates list endpoint compressed + slim (B17)** — `tower_http::CompressionLayer` now gzip-compresses JSON responses ≥4KB. `GET /api/templates` returns only `{id, name, description, category, icon, is_builtin, created_at}` (was 500 KB plain, now ~86 KB gzipped). Full `compose_template` and `env_schema` bodies are at `GET /api/templates/:id`. Cache headers updated to `public, max-age=300, stale-while-revalidate=900`.
- **Database SQL backup downloads use `application/sql` Content-Type (B26)** — Was `application/octet-stream`; browsers can now display rather than save-as.
- **Compose service auto-domain fallback (B27)** — When no `instance_domain` is set, new compose services now auto-assign `<service-name>.local` so the service is reachable via the proxy without a manual domain step.

### Frontend bug fixes (VM sweep B1, B2, B16, B18, B19, B21, B22, B23, B24, U2, U4, U10)
- **B1** Setup form placeholder + zod validator now agree on **12-character** minimum (server already required 12).
- **B2** App General tab hides the "Dockerfile path" field when `build_type !== "dockerfile"`.
- **B16** Network tab no longer renders the wrong network name `"rivetr-network"`; the actual network is `"rivetr"`.
- **B18** Templates page first-paint card count drops from ~1300 to <100 by capping each category to 6 cards in the "all" view with a "View all N" link.
- **B19** `/monitoring` no longer logs the `width(-1) and height(-1)` recharts warning — chart wrapper now has explicit `min-h-[220px]`.
- **B21** Setup → auto-login when the API returns a session token; falls back to `/login` only when no token is included.
- **B22** Deployment detail page label switches from "Finished" to "Deployed at" while the status is `running`.
- **B23** Project page no longer renders duplicate empty-state CTA buttons (responsive split was double-rendering).
- **B24** Form `autocomplete` attrs added (`email` / `new-password` / `current-password` / `name`) so password managers and iOS strong-password generators work correctly.
- **U2** Login submit button is disabled when email or password is empty.
- **U4** Project page hides the Healthy/Issues/Building tabs when a project has zero apps.
- **U10** Deployment-log render strips ANSI escape sequences (e.g. `\x1b[33m`).

### Infrastructure
- Added `scripts/deploy-vm.sh` for fast Parallels-VM iteration on Apple Silicon.
- 7 pre-existing clippy errors fixed (`fix/clippy-baseline`); `cargo clippy --all-targets --all-features -- -D warnings` now exits 0.

### Known limitations carried into v0.10.21
- B6 — MySQL 8 default SSL breaks the published `mysql://` connection string. Need either a server-side SSL-disable on the managed DB or a `?ssl-mode=DISABLED` suffix.
- B8 — `ClientIp` extractor staged in `src/api/audit.rs` but not wired into handlers. `audit_log.ip_address` remains null. Mechanical wiring across ~30 handlers planned for the next release.
- B12/B13 fixes are in code but not yet exercised on a multi-deploy app.
- B20 — Disk usage path inconsistency (`/` vs `/var/lib/rivetr`) between Dashboard and Monitoring page.
- B25 — DB-to-app env-var auto-injection UI (manual copy still required).
- 8 frontend fixes pass static-bundle inspection but need a Playwright pass before they're claimed validated.

[0.10.20]: https://github.com/KwaminaWhyte/rivetr/compare/v0.10.19...v0.10.20

## [v0.10.19] - 2026-03-25

### Fixed
- **Zero-downtime HTTPS during instance restarts** — Proxy listeners are now pre-bound once in `main.rs` using a single `ListenFd::from_env()` call and passed to the HTTP and HTTPS servers. Previously, each server created its own `ListenFd` instance; the `listenfd` crate clears `LISTEN_FDS` after the first call, so the HTTPS server never inherited its systemd socket and fell back to a fresh `TcpListener::bind(443)` that failed with "Address already in use" while the socket unit still held the port. With this fix, both sockets are inherited correctly and connections queue at the kernel level during restarts instead of receiving ECONNREFUSED.

## [v0.10.18] - 2026-03-25

### Added
- **Service resource monitor** — The service detail page now shows live CPU, memory, and network stats (same `ResourceMonitor` component used by apps and databases). Stats are only shown when the service is running.
- **Service public port exposure** — Services can now expose a container port directly on the host, identical to the managed database "Make Public" feature. Configure via the new **Network** tab on the service detail page: set a host port, container port, and toggle public access. Port conflicts are checked against other services and public databases. Changing the setting auto-restarts a running service to apply the new binding. (Migration `105_service_public_access.sql`)
- **Full backup includes service data** — The full system backup now includes:
  - Compose files for all services (`services/{name}/docker-compose.yml` in the archive)
  - Database dumps for running service containers: `pg_dumpall` for PostgreSQL, `mysqldump --all-databases` for MySQL/MariaDB, `BGSAVE` + dump.rdb for Redis/KeyDB/Dragonfly, `mongodump --archive` for MongoDB. All dump failures are non-fatal (logged as warnings).

### Fixed
- **Migrations 104 and 105 not auto-applied** — Both new migrations were included in the binary but not registered in the migration runner. Added idempotent guards so they are applied automatically on the next startup.

## [v0.10.17] - 2026-03-25

### Changed
- **AI provider config moved to dashboard** — The AI provider, API key, model, and max-token cap are now configured from **Settings → AI Provider** in the Rivetr dashboard and stored in the `instance_settings` database table. No server restart is required; changes are hot-applied immediately.
  - Migration `104_ai_settings.sql` adds `ai_provider`, `ai_api_key`, `ai_model`, and `ai_max_tokens` rows to `instance_settings`.
  - `GET /api/settings/instance` response now includes `ai_provider`, `ai_configured` (boolean), `ai_model`, and `ai_max_tokens`. The raw API key is never returned.
  - `PUT /api/settings/instance` accepts the new AI fields and hot-reloads the in-memory `AiClient` (`parking_lot::RwLock<Option<Arc<AiClient>>>`) without a restart.
  - The `[ai]` section in `rivetr.toml` is still supported as a startup fallback when no key exists in the database.

### Added
- **Settings → AI Provider card** — New UI card on the Settings page to configure the AI provider (Claude, OpenAI, Gemini, Moonshot), API key (masked input with show/hide toggle), model override, and max-tokens cap. Shows a "Configured" badge when a key is already set.

## [v0.10.16] - 2026-03-25

### Added
- **AI-powered features** — Phase 1 AI integration across the platform. All features require an `[ai]` section with a provider API key in `rivetr.toml`.
  - **Multi-provider AI client** (`src/ai.rs`) — supports Claude (Anthropic), OpenAI, Gemini, and Moonshot (OpenAI-compatible) with automatic fallback summaries when no key is configured.
  - **Deployment error diagnosis** — `POST /api/apps/:id/deployments/:did/diagnose` sends the last 80 log lines to the AI and returns a structured diagnosis with up to 4 actionable suggestions. Accessible via the deployment detail page.
  - **Deployment insights** — `GET /api/apps/:id/insights` computes success rate, average build time, and trend over 30 days, optionally enriched with a one-sentence AI summary on the app overview page.
  - **Cost optimisation suggestions** — `GET /api/apps/:id/cost-suggestions` returns AI-generated resource tuning recommendations visible on the Monitoring tab.
  - **Dockerfile Optimizer** (`#6`) — `POST /api/apps/:id/suggest-dockerfile` asks the AI to analyse the stored Dockerfile and return an optimised version with a list of improvements. Surfaced in Settings → Build.
  - **Security & Compliance Advisor** (`#11`) — `GET /api/apps/:id/security-scan` runs five rule-based checks (untagged images, missing healthcheck, no domain, empty secret env vars, credential patterns in logs) and optionally requests an AI executive summary. New **Security** tab added to every app.
  - **Global security scan** — `GET /api/security/scan` runs all checks across every app and returns an aggregated report.
  - `docs/planning/ai-opportunities.md` documents all 12 AI opportunities across three phases.

## [v0.10.15] - 2026-03-25

### Fixed
- **ACME cert saved under wrong directory on renewal** — `save_certificate` now takes an explicit `instance_domain` parameter instead of deriving the path from the cert's CN. Certificates written during renewal now land in the correct directory and survive restarts.
- **Uptime checker skipped apps with no custom domain** — The uptime poller now falls back to `auto_subdomain` when an app has no custom domain configured. Health-check requests to `*.rivetr.site` subdomains are now issued over HTTPS.
- **Monitoring page showed "100% availability" with 0 checks** — The availability percentage now renders `"-"` instead of `"100%"` when `total_checks` is zero, avoiding a misleading stat on freshly-added monitors.
- **Uptime summary stats ignored period selector** — The period dropdown on the Monitoring page now threads the selected value through to `GET /api/uptime?period=` on the backend and re-fetches summary stats when the period changes.
- **Health check path for expediting app** — The expediting app's health-check path is now set to `/up` to match the actual health endpoint.
- **Westel Dockerfiles** — Removed BuildKit cache mounts (`--mount=type=cache`) that are unsupported by the legacy Docker API builder, upgraded PHP 8.3 → 8.4, and preserved layer-ordering optimisations.

---

## [v0.10.13] - 2026-03-22

### Fixed
- **App API boolean types** — All app endpoints (`list_apps`, `get_app`, `create_app`, `update_app`, `assign_app_project`, `list_server_apps`) were returning raw SQLite `App` models which store booleans as `i32`. Changed all endpoints to return `AppResponse`, which properly maps integer columns to JSON booleans, fixing `"invalid type: integer 1, expected a boolean"` deserialization errors on the frontend.
- **Frontend error handling for non-JSON responses** — The `apiRequest` helper in `core.ts` rethrew `SyntaxError` from `JSON.parse` in a confusing way, surfacing messages like `"Unexpected token 'F', 'Failed to'... is not valid JSON"`. Fixed by catching `instanceof SyntaxError` and raising the raw text body as the error message instead.
- **Docker image prune filter** — `docker system prune --filter dangling=true` is invalid; system prune does not accept a `dangling` filter. Fixed the manual cleanup endpoint to use `docker image prune -f` instead.
- **Full system backup failure** — `ManagedDatabase` SELECT queries listed explicit columns that were missing newer schema fields (e.g. `ssl_enabled`, `ssl_mode`, `custom_image`, `init_commands`), causing backups to fail with column-not-found errors. Fixed by using `SELECT *`.
- **Firewall security check false positive** — `"Status: inactive".contains("active")` evaluated to `true`, incorrectly marking inactive firewalls as green. Fixed the check to require `active` without `inactive` (e.g. `ufw status` → `Status: active`) or the word `running` (for firewalld).

### Added
- **Webhook events pagination** — `GET /api/webhook-events` now accepts `page` and `per_page` (default 50, max 200) query parameters and returns a `WebhookEventListResponse` envelope with `items`, `total`, `page`, `per_page`, and `total_pages`. The Settings → Webhook Events page stores pagination state in URL search params so it survives navigation.
- **Disk pressure auto-cleanup** — The deployment cleanup engine now checks disk usage via `statvfs` before each cycle. When the root filesystem exceeds 85% full it automatically switches to aggressive mode: keeps only the single most-recent deployment per app, prunes all unused images, and purges the Docker build cache — preventing disk exhaustion without manual intervention.
- **Docker build cache pruning** — Every cleanup cycle now runs `docker builder prune -f` after image pruning. Build cache can grow to tens of GBs and was previously never cleared; this reclaims that space automatically.
- **Reduced default deployment retention** — `max_deployments_per_app` default lowered from 10 to 3, reducing idle disk consumption for deployments with large images.

---

## [v0.10.12] - 2026-03-18

### Added
- **Proxy access logs** — Every HTTP request through the Rivetr reverse proxy is now logged to a `proxy_logs` SQLite table (migration `103_proxy_logs.sql`). Logs capture host, method, path, status code, response time (ms), bytes out, client IP, and user agent. Accessible via `GET /api/proxy/logs` (with `domain`, `status`, `limit`, `offset` query params) and a new **Settings → Proxy Logs** page with filters and auto-refresh toggle.
- **User Preferences panel** — New **Settings → Preferences** page with instant localStorage-based preferences: theme (Light/Dark/System), date/time display format (relative vs absolute), default log lines (100/500/1000/All), deployment notifications toggle, and compact mode toggle.
- **11 new service templates (Sprint 26)** — MediaWiki (CMS), SuperTokens (Auth/SSO), Netbird (Networking), AFFiNE (Productivity), HeyForm (Forms), OpnForm (Forms), GitHub Actions Runner (DevTools), Bluesky PDS (Communication), PeerTube (Media), Roundcube (Productivity), Mailserver/docker-mailserver (Infrastructure). Rivetr now has **335+ one-click templates**.

---

## [v0.10.11] - 2026-03-18

### Added
- **Custom container labels** — Apps now support arbitrary Docker container labels via a key-value editor in Settings → Network. Labels are stored as JSON in `custom_labels` (migration `102_custom_labels.sql`) and applied to containers at launch time alongside built-in Rivetr labels.
- **Proxy-level www redirect** — The `www_redirect_mode` feature now issues HTTP 301 redirects at the proxy layer. Redirect-only domains are registered as dedicated proxy backends; the proxy handler fires the redirect before any upstream connection is made, so no container traffic is involved.
- **5 new service templates (Sprint 25)** — Joomla (CMS), Drupal (CMS), Grafana standalone (Monitoring), Etebase (Auth/SSO), Obsidian Remote (Productivity). Rivetr now has 315+ one-click templates.

### Fixed
- **Missing migrations 092–099** — The migration runner in `src/db/mod.rs` was missing all migrations between 091 and 100, causing 500 errors on all app and server API endpoints when those columns were referenced by model structs.
- **Migration 101 column check** — The `destinations` migration guard only checked for table existence, not for the `destination_id` column on `apps`. `DELETE /api/destinations/:id` returned 500 on fresh deployments; fixed by checking column presence.

---

## [v0.10.10] - 2026-03-18

### Added
- **Docker Destinations** — Named Docker networks that apps can be assigned to, mirroring Coolify's "destinations" concept. Create destinations in Settings → Destinations; assign an app via its Network settings page. Migration `101_destinations.sql`. API: `GET/POST /api/destinations`, `GET/DELETE /api/destinations/:id`.
- **CA Certificate management** — Upload trusted CA certificates (PEM) for custom TLS trust chains. Migration `100_ca_certs.sql`. API: `GET/POST /api/ca-certificates`, `DELETE /api/ca-certificates/:id`. UI at Settings → CA Certificates.
- **Inline Dockerfile** — Deploy from a pasted Dockerfile with no git repo. `inline_dockerfile` field (migration `098_inline_dockerfile`), textarea in Build Settings, skips git clone entirely.
- **Fetch server details** — `POST /api/servers/:id/fetch-details` SSHes in and collects OS name, Docker version, free disk, CPU cores, and total RAM. "Refresh details" in the server actions dropdown + Server Details dialog.
- **WWW redirect mode** — Per-domain `www_redirect_mode` replaces `redirect_www` with a 4-option dropdown: No redirect / Serve both / → www / → non-www. Proxy issues HTTP 301 redirects for the redirect variants; canonical domain proxies normally. Backward-compatible; in Domain Management card.
- **Instance timezone** — Global IANA timezone for scheduled tasks and log timestamps. Stored in `instance_settings`, configurable from Settings → General.
- **11 new service templates (Sprint 24)** — Vaultwarden, LiteLLM, MindsDB, Matrix Synapse, Rocket.Chat, NodeBB, Zipline, Joplin Server, Siyuan Notes, Hatchet, EasyAppointments. Rivetr now has ~113 one-click templates.

---

## [v0.10.9] - 2026-03-18

### Fixed
- **Cost analysis pricing** — Cost estimates were wildly low (showing `$0.01` for a server that actually costs `$4.82`) because the calculator used per-utilisation rates of `$0.02/vCPU/month` and `$0.05/GB/month` — roughly 300–600× below real cloud pricing. Three changes fix this:
  1. **Server-based cost model** — each server now has a configurable `hourly_rate` (default `$0.036/hr` matching DigitalOcean s-2vcpu-4gb at `$24/mo`). When an app is assigned to a server, its daily cost is `hourly_rate × 24 × (app_memory_limit / server_memory_total)` — mirroring how cloud providers actually bill (reserved capacity, not utilisation).
  2. **DO-aligned fallback rates** — for apps not assigned to a server the rate-based model now uses `$10/vCPU/month` + `$1/GB/month`, matching DO Basic Regular pricing (2 vCPU × $10 + 4 GB × $1 = $24/mo).
  3. **Bill allocated memory, not used memory** — the fallback model now charges against `memory_limit_bytes` (what the container is allocated) rather than actual bytes consumed.
- Migration `099_server_hourly_rate.sql` adds `hourly_rate` to `servers` and updates the `cost_rates` seed defaults.

### Added
- **Hourly rate field on servers** — Settings → Servers edit dialog now includes an "Hourly Cost (USD/hr)" input with DigitalOcean size hints, so each server's rate can be corrected to match the actual cloud bill.

---

### Added
- **Docker Destinations** — Named Docker networks that apps can be assigned to, mirroring Coolify's "destinations" concept. Create destinations (network name → Docker bridge network) in Settings → Destinations; assign an app to a destination via its Network settings page. Containers join the selected network instead of the default `rivetr` bridge. Migration `101_destinations.sql`. API: `GET/POST /api/destinations`, `GET/DELETE /api/destinations/:id`.
- **WWW redirect mode** — Per-domain `www_redirect_mode` replaces the old boolean `redirect_www` with a 4-option dropdown: No redirect, Serve both, → www (redirect non-www to www), → non-www (redirect www to non-www). Stored in the existing `domains` JSON column, fully backward-compatible. Exposed in the Domain Management card.
- **Fetch server details** — New `POST /api/servers/:id/fetch-details` endpoint SSHes into a server and collects OS name, Docker version, free disk, CPU cores, and total RAM. Accessible via Refresh details in the server actions dropdown; results shown in a Server Details dialog.
- **CA Certificate management** — Upload trusted CA certificates (PEM format) for custom TLS trust chains. Certificates stored in new `ca_certificates` table (migration `100`). API: `GET/POST /api/ca-certificates`, `DELETE /api/ca-certificates/:id`. Management UI at Settings → CA Certificates.
- **Instance timezone** — Global timezone setting for scheduled tasks and log timestamps, configurable from the Settings → General page. Stored in `instance_settings` as key `instance_timezone`.
- **Git clone options** — Per-app toggles for `git_submodules` (passes `--recurse-submodules`), `git_lfs` (runs `git lfs pull` after clone), and `shallow_clone` (controls `--depth 1`; default on for speed). Migration `094_git_build_options.sql`.
- **Build cache control** — `disable_build_cache` toggle passes `--no-cache` to Dockerfile/Nixpacks builds (Docker and Podman), forcing a clean layer rebuild on every deploy.
- **SOURCE_COMMIT build arg** — `include_source_commit` toggle injects the current git SHA as the `SOURCE_COMMIT` Docker build argument so it can be baked into the image.
- **Custom container name** — `custom_container_name` field overrides the auto-generated `rivetr-<app-name>` container name. All options exposed in the app's Build Settings page.
- **Static site flag** — `is_static_site` boolean marks an app as a static site (migration `095_static_site.sql`). Toggle in Build Settings page under Build Options.
- **Generate domain** — `POST /api/apps/:id/generate-domain` auto-assigns a random subdomain using the server's base domain (falls back to `sslip.io`). Exposed as a Generate (wand) button in the Domain Management card.
- **Links dropdown** — App layout nav now includes a Links dropdown showing all configured domains as quick-open external links.
- **Environment Clone** — Clone any project environment to instantly duplicate its apps (with env vars and volumes), databases, and services into a new environment. New environment starts clean: containers not running, domains cleared, deployment state reset. API: `POST /api/projects/:project_id/environments/:env_id/clone`. Frontend: Clone button on each environment tab opens a dialog to name the new environment.
- **11 new service templates (Sprint 24)** — Vaultwarden (Security); LiteLLM, MindsDB (AI/ML); Matrix Synapse, Rocket.Chat, NodeBB (Communication); Zipline (File Storage); Joplin Server, Siyuan Notes (Productivity); Hatchet (Automation); EasyAppointments (Business). Rivetr now has ~113 one-click service templates.
- **8 new service templates (Sprint 23)** — Flowise, Langflow, Open WebUI, AnythingLLM (AI/ML); Pocket ID (Auth/SSO); Activepieces, Trigger.dev (Automation); SigNoz (Monitoring). Rivetr now has ~102 one-click service templates.
- **Inline Dockerfile (no git required)** — Apps can now be deployed from an inline Dockerfile stored in the DB (`inline_dockerfile` field, migration `098`). If set, the build pipeline skips git clone entirely and builds from the pasted Dockerfile content. Accessible via the Build Settings page textarea when build type is "dockerfile".
- **Server timezone setting** — Per-server `timezone` field (IANA timezone string, default `UTC`). Migration `096_server_timezone.sql`. Exposed in the Edit Server dialog on the Servers settings page.
- **Strip URL prefix** — Per-app `strip_prefix` field removes a URL prefix before proxying to the container (e.g. `/api`). Migration `097_app_strip_prefix.sql`. Proxy strips the prefix in both HTTP and WebSocket forwarding. UI in app Network settings. Applied to rollback, bulk ops, and route restores on startup.
- **Resend notification channel** — Fixed validation for `resend`, `mattermost`, `lark`, and `gotify` channel types (they were previously blocked by the `validate_channel_config` fallthrough). All four channel types now accept and validate their required config fields.
- **Theme toggle in top nav** — The Light/Dark/System theme toggle is now directly accessible from the top navigation header bar (in addition to the sidebar user menu).
- **Version + feedback in sidebar** — Sidebar footer now shows the current version number (fetched from `/api/system/version`) as a link to GitHub releases, plus a Feedback link to open a GitHub issue.
- **7 new service templates (Sprint 22)** — Minecraft Java, Palworld, Terraria, Satisfactory (Gaming); Argilla, Mage AI (AI/ML); Glitchtip (Monitoring). Rivetr now has ~94 one-click service templates.
- **13 new service templates (Sprint 21)** — Beszel Agent, ClassicPress, CloudBeaver, Diun, Homebox, Karakeep, Linkding, PairDrop, Readeck, Ryot, Shlink, Slash, and Wakapi. Rivetr now has ~87 one-click service templates.

---

## [v0.10.8] - 2026-03-17

### Fixed
- **Server status stuck offline** — The SSH health check tried a stored key that failed to load (`error in libcrypto`) and did not fall back to password auth, leaving the server permanently offline. Fixed by retrying with `sshpass` password auth when the key-based attempt fails.
- **Server action buttons cluttered** — Replaced the flat row of 6+ buttons with a clean layout: Terminal and Files as primary buttons, with Check health / Updates / Security audit / Install Docker / Remove server grouped in a `⋯` dropdown.

---

## [v0.10.7] - 2026-03-16

### Added
- **Service resource monitoring** — Built-in template services (Redis, PostgreSQL, MinIO, etc.) now have a Stats tab showing live CPU usage, RAM usage/limit, and network RX/TX. The new `GET /api/services/:id/stats` endpoint aggregates metrics across all containers in the service's Compose project.
- **Deployment Cleanup Settings UI** — Admins can now configure `max_deployments_per_app` (number of old deployments to keep per app) and `prune_images` (whether to prune dangling Docker images after cleanup) directly from the Settings page without editing `rivetr.toml`. Values persist in the `instance_settings` table; the cleanup engine reads them on each cycle, falling back to config-file defaults when not set.
- **Restart History in Deployments Tab** — App restarts now create deployment records with full logs and a distinct "restart" trigger badge in the deployments timeline (migration 093 adds `trigger` column; violet badge in `deployment-timeline.tsx`).
- **TUI (`rivetr tui`)**: terminal UI for managing Rivetr from the command line; tabbed Apps/Deployments/Servers/Logs views; keyboard navigation (d=deploy, s=stop, r=restart, ?=help); live log polling every 5s; connects to any instance via --url/--token; built with ratatui + crossterm (enable with `--features tui`)
- **Fine-grained RBAC** — Per-resource permission overrides allow team admins to grant or deny individual members access to specific apps, projects, databases, or services. Overrides are stored in the new `team_resource_permissions` table (migration 089). Managed via GET/PUT `/api/teams/:id/members/:user_id/permissions` and DELETE `/api/teams/:id/members/:user_id/permissions/:perm_id`. Admin UI available as a dialog in team member settings.
- **Deployment Queue Cancellation** — Any queued or running deployment can now be cancelled via the Cancel button in the deployment detail view. The backend records `cancelled_at` (migration 090) and signals the engine's per-deployment `CancellationToken` to abort the current pipeline stage.
- **Community Template Submissions** — Users can submit custom Docker Compose templates for admin review from a new Submit dialog on the Templates page. Submissions are stored in `community_template_submissions` (migration 091) with `pending`/`approved`/`rejected` status. Admins review from an All Submissions page; approved submissions are automatically promoted to the live service template registry. Users can track their own submissions from My Submissions.
- **Remote Filesystem Browser** — Browse, read, write, and delete files on any connected remote server over SSH. API: `GET /api/servers/:id/files` (directory listing), `GET /api/servers/:id/files/content` (read), `PUT /api/servers/:id/files/content` (write), `DELETE /api/servers/:id/files` (delete). Frontend: full file browser at `/servers/:id/files` with breadcrumb navigation and inline text editor. Accessible via the new Files button on the Servers settings page.

### Fixed
- **GitHub App webhooks silently dropped by HTTPS redirect** — When HTTPS is enabled, the HTTP proxy redirects all port-80 traffic to HTTPS. GitHub (and all webhook providers) do not follow HTTP redirects, so GitHub App push events were silently dropped after the TLS cert was first issued. Fixed by excluding `/webhooks/` paths from the HTTP→HTTPS redirect in the proxy handler so webhook payloads are forwarded directly regardless of TLS state.
- **GitHub App webhook URL uses wrong scheme after domain/HTTPS setup** — The manifest generation used the `external_url` as-is; if that was `http://…`, the registered webhook URL was HTTP. After adding `external_url = "https://…"` the URL is now HTTPS by default. A new `POST /api/github-apps/:id/sync-webhook` endpoint (and matching "Sync Webhook URL" option in the GitHub Apps UI) updates the GitHub App's registered webhook URL on GitHub via `PATCH /app/hook/config` using the app's JWT.
- **App settings page never showed webhook setup instructions** — The General Settings tab now shows an "Auto-Deploy Setup" card with the ready-to-paste webhook URL for the detected provider (GitHub / GitLab / Gitbucket / Gitea) and step-by-step configuration instructions, so users know what to configure without leaving Rivetr.
- **Duplicate webhook deployments on push** — Four overlapping bugs caused GitHub pushes to trigger double deploys: (1) The delivery-ID guard was a read-only check with no atomic claim, so two concurrent deliveries both passed before either wrote its audit row. Fixed with `INSERT OR IGNORE` to atomically claim the delivery ID before any work begins. (2) Branch deletion events (`deleted: true`, `after` all-zeros) were not filtered and triggered a deployment with no commit. Fixed by adding early-exit guards for deletions and non-branch refs. (3) No per-app idempotency check existed before inserting a deployment row. Fixed by wrapping the check+insert in a `BEGIN IMMEDIATE` transaction. (4) The active-deployment status check used `status IN ('pending', 'running')` — the engine transitions to `'building'` within milliseconds, so a second webhook arriving ~76ms later found zero active rows. Fixed by inverting the check to `status NOT IN ('succeeded', 'failed', 'cancelled', 'replaced')`, catching deployments in any in-progress state.
- **CPU chart compared against full host CPU instead of allocated limit** — The Resource Monitor CPU% was reported as a percentage of one full core (Docker's raw metric), making a container using its entire 0.25-core allocation show as 25% instead of 100%. The `ResourceMonitor` component now accepts a `cpuLimit` prop (in cores) and normalises the raw value so 100% means the container is at its allocated quota. Progress bar label also updates to show the limit (e.g. "CPU (of 0.25 cores limit)").
- **API Token Auth in Middleware** — `rvt_`-prefixed API tokens were only validated inside the `User` extractor (used by handlers that declare a user parameter). The `auth_middleware` itself only checked session tokens and the admin config token, causing 401s on endpoints like `GET /api/apps` that don't use the user extractor. Fixed by adding an `api_tokens` DB lookup in `auth_middleware` for `rvt_`-prefixed tokens, with a fire-and-forget `last_used_at` update.
- **TUI ping using auth-required endpoint** — `ping()` called `/api/system/health` (auth required), causing the TUI to show "Disconnected" even when the server was reachable but the token was invalid. Changed to use the public `/health` endpoint so connectivity and auth failures are reported separately.
- **TUI `/api/deployments` 404** — No global deployments endpoint exists; they are per-app. Fixed by replacing the single global query with per-app requests (up to 5 apps × 5 deployments, merged and sorted by date) inside the `refresh()` cycle.
- **Stale `container_id` causing stuck 'starting' state** — When `start_database_container` was called for a database whose `container_id` pointed to a Docker container that had been removed externally, the engine would get stuck in `starting` forever. Now, when any Docker operation fails because the container is gone, Rivetr clears `container_id`, resets the database status to `stopped`, and provisions a fresh container instead.
- **Reconciliation queries failing after new migrations** — `reconcile_databases` and `reconcile_services` in `src/engine/container_monitor/recovery.rs` used explicit column lists in their SELECT statements. Any new migration adding a column caused `no column found` deserialization errors and silently broke recovery. Both queries now use `SELECT *` to stay resilient to schema additions.
- **5-field cron expressions rejected by scheduler** — The cron crate requires a 6-field expression (with a leading seconds field). Scheduled-restart cron strings entered by users (5-field, standard Unix format) caused a parse error and silently disabled the restart schedule. Fixed by prepending `0 ` to normalize any 5-field expression before passing it to the cron library.
- **React setState-during-render in LogRetentionSection** — Synchronous state updates inside the render path in `LogRetentionSection` (`monitoring.tsx`) triggered React warnings and potential infinite re-render loops. Moved the sync call to a `useEffect` to comply with React's rules.
- **MySQL/MariaDB user not created on reused data directory** — Docker MySQL/MariaDB images only create `MYSQL_USER` on first boot when the data directory is empty. Reusing a bind-mount from a previous container silently skips init scripts, leaving the app user missing and causing `SQLSTATE[HY000] [1130] Host … not allowed`. Rivetr now provisions the user idempotently via the Unix socket (`CREATE USER IF NOT EXISTS … GRANT ALL`) after every container start, retrying for up to 30 s.
- **New app subdomains missing SSL coverage** — The TLS certificate was only issued once at startup and never reissued when new apps were deployed. New subdomains had no HTTPS until the cert's 90-day expiry renewal. Fixed with: (1) `TlsReloadHandle` wrapping the TLS acceptor in an `Arc<RwLock>` so the cert can be hot-swapped without restarting the HTTPS server; (2) the renewal manager now queries the DB on each cycle and immediately reissues the cert if any new app subdomains are found; (3) `domains.json` is saved alongside the PEM files so Rivetr knows exactly which SANs were in the cert after a restart.
- **Orphaned restart containers causing CPU/RAM drain** — `zero-downtime restart` spawned a fire-and-forget task to stop/remove the old container; if this task failed silently, the old container kept running and consumed resources. On startup, Rivetr now removes all `rivetr-*-restart-*` containers that are not the active deployment container. The stop/remove task also logs WARN on failure for visibility.
- **No swap warning** — Rivetr now logs a WARN at startup if the host has no swap configured (`SwapTotal: 0` in `/proc/meminfo`), and the installer (`install.sh`) automatically creates a 2–4 GB swapfile with `swappiness=10`.

### Planned
- SAML 2.0 support
- Remote build execution (SSH-based, RemoteContext foundation in place)
- Overlay networking for Docker Swarm
- Rolling updates with Swarm

---

## [0.10.6] - 2026-03-14

### Added
- **Container Resource Limits UI** — CPU and memory limits are now configurable per app from Settings → Docker Options. A new "Apply Now (Live)" button enforces limits on the running container immediately via `docker update` (cgroup changes, no redeploy needed). Useful for throttling runaway containers without downtime.
- **DragonFlyDB** — New managed database type. Redis-compatible, port 6379, `redis://` connection string, RDB backup format.
- **KeyDB** — New managed database type. Redis-compatible with multi-threading, port 6379, `redis://` connection string.
- **ClickHouse** — New managed database type. Analytics-focused columnar store on port 8123, `clickhouse://` connection string, `CLICKHOUSE_DEFAULT_ACCESS_MANAGEMENT=1` enabled by default, post-start database init.
- **Docker Compose Raw Mode** — New per-service toggle that deploys the compose file exactly as written, skipping all Rivetr network injection, container name namespacing, and label additions. Essential for services with opinionated internal networking.
- **Ansible Playbook** — `ansible/rivetr.yml` provides an idempotent playbook for automated server provisioning on Ubuntu 22.04/24.04 and Debian 12. Installs Docker, downloads the Rivetr binary, configures systemd service, and sets up UFW firewall rules.
- **Service Templates Master Registry** — `docs/reference/service-templates.md` lists all 273 unique templates by category with IDs and source files. Referenced before adding new templates to prevent duplicates.

### Fixed
- **Duplicate Service Templates** — Removed 55 duplicate template entries (same app, different IDs across sprint files). Total unique templates reduced from 328 → 273 after full deduplication. All future templates must be checked against `docs/reference/service-templates.md` first.
- **Env Vars in Storage Settings** — Removed the duplicate Environment Variables panel from Settings → Storage. Env vars are only managed from the dedicated Env Vars tab.

---

## [0.10.5] - 2026-03-13

### Added
- **27 New Service Templates** — Added templates across 7 categories: Administration/Dashboards (Homepage, Homarr, Dashy, Organizr), AI Services (AnythingLLM, LibreChat, Langflow, LiteLLM, LibreTranslate), Analytics (GoatCounter, OpenPanel), Backup (Duplicati), Communication (Matrix Synapse), Development Tools (NocoDB, Budibase, Dozzle, Portainer CE, Jenkins, Appsmith), Media Servers (Plex, Emby, qBittorrent, Sonarr, Radarr), Storage (Nextcloud, Seafile), Security (Pi-hole). Total templates now ~119.
- **Port Conflict Validation** — Users are now prevented from using ports already in use across the entire platform. Validation occurs in three places:
  - Service template deployment: real-time debounced check (400ms) with red-border indicator and disabled deploy button
  - Custom service creation: server-side 409 Conflict response
  - Database `external_port` update: server-side 409 Conflict response with descriptive error toast
  - New `GET /api/services/check-port?port=N` endpoint returning `{ available, conflict }` for frontend checks
- **Auto-Subdomain for Template Services** — Services deployed from templates now automatically get a subdomain (`{name}.{base_domain}`) with a proxy route registered on startup, making them accessible via domain instead of raw `host:port` URLs.

### Fixed
- **Service Stop Status** — Services deployed from templates were showing "Failed" after stop instead of "Stopped". Root cause: `stop_service` was using `get_compose_dir` (data dir only) instead of `get_service_compose_dir` (falls back to temp dir used by template deployments).

---

## [0.10.4] - 2026-03-12

### Added
- **API Tokens** — Users can now create named API tokens for programmatic access. Tokens are shown once on creation (prefixed `rvt_`), stored as SHA-256 hashes, and support optional expiry dates. The `/api/tokens` CRUD endpoints are available to all authenticated users. Existing scripts using the admin config token are unaffected.

### Fixed
- **Version Reporting** — `Cargo.toml` version now correctly reflects the deployed release so that the Auto Updates page reports the accurate running version.
- **Breadcrumbs** — Several routes were falling through to the "Page" fallback. Added entries for `/costs` (Cost Analysis) and dynamic patterns for app sub-tabs: Previews, Jobs, Log Drains, and Monitoring.
- **Notification Channels 403** — Team notification channels endpoint now correctly grants access when authenticating with the admin API token (system user bypass was missing from `require_team_role` in notifications.rs).
- **Team Breadcrumb** — The team detail page breadcrumb now shows the team name (e.g. "Teams > Personal") instead of the generic "Page" fallback.
- **Build Server Docker Column** — Docker version column no longer shows "vnot installed" — the `v` prefix is only added when the version string starts with a digit.
- **SSH Password Auth for Servers & Build Servers** — Servers and build servers can now be registered using a password (no SSH key required). `sshpass` is used transparently for health checks and terminal connections when no key is provided.

---

## [0.10.3] - 2026-03-12

### Added
- **Recharts Dashboard** — Replaced custom SVG charts with Recharts across the dashboard and monitoring pages for improved interactivity and maintainability.
- **Service Domain Routing** — Docker Compose services now support a configurable domain (auto-populated as `{name}.{base_domain}`) with full proxy integration: routes registered on start, removed on stop/delete, and restored on server startup.
- **Service Restart Button** — Services now have a Restart button (alongside Stop) when running.

### Fixed
- **Proxy Route Restore on Startup** — Running apps now have their proxy routes fully restored after a Rivetr restart (binary update). The startup `restore_routes` function now falls back to `inspect()` when `list_containers` doesn't return a port, and also restores Basic Auth config and `www.` redirect variants. This prevents 404s for all apps after a server update.
- **Audit Log User Display** — The audit log now shows the user's email address instead of their UUID. Backend does a `LEFT JOIN users` and returns `user_email` in the response.
- **Audit Log Resource Type Formatting** — Multi-word resource types like `ssh_key` now display as "SSH Key" instead of "Ssh_key".
- **SSH Key Delete Audit Log** — Deleting an SSH key now records the key name (not the UUID) in the audit log resource_name field.
- **DB Backup Download 401** — Database backup downloads now correctly include the Authorization header by falling back to the stored auth token when none is explicitly passed.
- **Database Data Directory Uniqueness** — The data directory for managed databases now includes the first 8 characters of the database UUID (e.g., `pharmapro-db-a1b2c3d4`) to prevent path collisions when databases with the same name are created across time.
- **Deployment Detail Status Badge** — The status badge on the deployment detail page now correctly shows "Running" for active deployments (was falling back to "Pending" because "running" was missing from STATUS_CONFIG). Also added "Replaced" and "Stopped" labels.
- **Service Logs Duplication** — Service log viewer no longer shows duplicate entries (was showing REST-fetched initial logs plus SSE-streamed history replay simultaneously).
- **Service Network Tab Open Link** — The "Open" button in the Service Network tab now uses the configured domain URL (when port matches service.port) instead of always using hostname:port.
- **Dashboard Stats Console Errors** — The `/api/apps/:id/stats` endpoint now returns zeroed stats (HTTP 200) for apps without a running deployment instead of 404, eliminating spurious browser console errors.
- **Recent Events: Replaced Status** — Deployments with status "replaced" (superseded by newer deploy) now show a descriptive event message instead of "unknown".
- **Deployment Log Streaming** — Build output from Docker and Nixpacks is now streamed in real time to deployment logs.
- **Logout Auth Header** — Logout now correctly passes the Authorization header and clears the stored token.
- **Team-Scoped Queries Backward Compat** — All team-scoped queries (`apps`, `databases`, `services`, `system stats`) now include `OR team_id IS NULL` so legacy resources without a team assignment remain visible.
- **Freeze Windows API Path** — Frontend now calls the correct endpoint `/api/apps/:id/freeze-windows` (was incorrectly using `/api/freeze-windows?app_id=...`).
- **Migration 067/068 Registration** — The `databases.container_slug` and `services.domain/port` migrations are registered in `run_migrations()` so columns are created on first run.
- **Admin API Token Permissions** — System/admin API token now has full access to all teams and can delete apps without requiring a password.
- **Stuck Deployments Cleanup** — Deployments stuck in `running` or `pending` state are now cleaned up on server startup.
- **TypeScript Fixes** — Fixed `DeploymentLog.id` type mismatch (`number` → `string`), `GitLabIcon` missing `style` prop, log sort using string timestamp comparison.

---

## [0.10.2] - 2026-03-11

### Added
- **Deployment Detail Page** — `/apps/:id/deployments/:deploymentId` shows real-time build logs via WebSocket, deployment metadata (commit, timing, status), and error details. Navigating to this page after triggering a deploy is now automatic.
- **GitLab Source in New App** — GitLab repo picker is now available in the new app creation form alongside GitHub.

### Fixed
- **Git Clone Authentication** — HTTPS clones for private GitHub, GitLab, and Bitbucket repos now inject the linked provider's OAuth/PAT token into the URL so git does not prompt for credentials (`fatal: could not read Username`). GitHub uses `x-access-token`, GitLab uses `oauth2:`, Bitbucket uses `x-token-auth:`. The `git_provider_id` is now stored on creation and looked up at deploy time.
- **App Name Validation** — Names are now auto-sanitized in the frontend (lowercase, spaces → dashes, invalid chars stripped) so the format error is never shown to users. Backend validation is also relaxed (single-char names allowed, trailing dashes allowed). Global uniqueness constraint removed — apps with the same name are now allowed (apps are identified by UUID).
- **Bitbucket Auth** — Updated from deprecated App Passwords to Atlassian API Tokens (ATATT prefix). Label and help link updated in the git providers settings.
- **HTTP→HTTPS Redirect** — Port 80 no longer redirects to HTTPS when no TLS certificate is available. The redirect is only activated after the certificate is confirmed.
- **Sidebar URL Restructure** — Infrastructure and access items (servers, teams, git-providers, ssh-keys, tokens, webhooks) are now at clean top-level URLs instead of `/settings/*`.
- **Missing Project Routes** — `/projects/:id/environments` and `/projects/:id/env-vars` are now registered and render correctly.

### Changed
- **Deployment Diff & Build Logs Modals** — Width increased to `max-w-5xl`/`max-w-4xl` (was `max-w-4xl`/`max-w-2xl`).
- **"View Full Logs" Button** — Now navigates to the deployment detail page instead of opening a small modal.
- **Deploy Button** — After triggering a deployment, the user is automatically taken to the deployment detail page to watch live logs.
- **Database Migration 066** — `apps.name` UNIQUE constraint removed. Existing data is preserved; all indexes are recreated.

---

## [0.10.1] - 2026-03-10

### Fixed
- **PackConfig Default** — `trust_builder` now correctly defaults to `true` in Rust's `Default` impl (was `false` due to `#[derive(Default)]`), fixing the `test_empty_config` test
- **Frontend TypeScript** — Fixed `running-services-card.tsx` passing raw `string` instead of `{ teamId }` option objects to `api.getApps/getDatabases/getServices`; removed reference to non-existent `app.current_deployment` field
- **servers.tsx** — Replaced `require("react")` inside component body with proper top-level imports (`useEffect`, `useRef`)
- **Cargo.toml** — Bumped version to `0.10.1` and fixed repository URL to `KwaminaWhyte/rivetr`
- **install.sh** — Fixed Railpack download URL (uses `-musl` not `-gnu`, includes version tag from GitHub API)
- **Database migrations** — Fixed startup crash: `execute_sql` split-on-semicolon parser now handles migration comments correctly; removed semicolon from comment in `061_registry_push.sql`
- **Database migrations** — Added missing migrations 051 (shared env vars), 052 (multi-server), 054 (container replicas), 055 (scheduled backups), 056 (2FA enforcement), 065 (webhook audit) to the migration runner

---
